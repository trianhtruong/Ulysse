# Ulysse

Ulysse is an open source webcrawler written in python.
It uses both the urllib.request library and BeautifulSoup.

The first planned features are basic web-crawling (from a starting url), collecting urls from a page to keep crawling, downloading source code as html, downloading source code as text and downloading specific content (text, images...).

To infinity and beyond !
